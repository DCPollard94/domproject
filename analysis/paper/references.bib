The texts are preceded by a substantial introduction, which surveys the geography, history, writing habits, social and political structure, economy, religion, and law of Crete in this period.

abstract = {This article explores in detail the mysterious lacuna in the record of Knossos during the sixth century BC, between the abandonment of the collective tombs of the Early Iron Age and the revival of the city's fortunes in Classial times. The archaeological evidence, indicating a deep recession, is marshalled in three chronological sections: (i) the full stop in the seventh century, (ii) the Archaic gap, and (iii) recovery in the fifth century. Parallel developments at Amnisos are also discussed. In the light of any relevant clues from the written record, we evaluate the likelihood of various possible causes of the sixth-century recession at Knossos, whether natural or human. /// Το $\alpha$$\upsilon$$\tau$ό $\delta$$\iota$$\epsilon$$\rho$$\epsilon$$\upsilon$$\nu$ά $\lambda$$\epsilon$$\pi$$\tau$ο$\mu$$\epsilon$$\rho$ώς $\tau$ο $\mu$$\upsilon$$\sigma$$\tau$$\eta$$\rho$$\iota$ώ$\delta$$\epsilon$ς $\kappa$$\epsilon$$\nu$ό $\pi$ο$\upsilon$ $\delta$$\iota$$\alpha$$\pi$$\iota$$\sigma$$\tau$ώ$\nu$$\epsilon$$\tau$$\alpha$$\iota$ $\sigma$$\tau$$\alpha$ $\delta$$\epsilon$$\delta$ο$\mu$έ$\nu$$\alpha$ $\tau$$\eta$ς Κ$\nu$$\omega$$\sigma$$\sigma$ού $\kappa$$\alpha$$\tau$ά $\tau$ο$\nu$ 60 $\alpha$$\iota$, $\pi$.
