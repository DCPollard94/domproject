abstract = {P. examines Eleutherna's trade during the Archaic period through the epigraphic and archaeological record. She uses comparative evidence from other parts of Crete to argue against a) the idea that Cretan commerce did not involve free citizens of cities (related to the traditional 'aristocratic' view of Cretans organized in syssitia, not engaged in commerce) and b) that the Cretan economy completely collapsed at the end of the Iron Age. She concludes that there is nothing to contradict the idea that Eleutherna's citizenry involved specialized craftsmen, and that its economy was not exclusively subsistence farming/husbandry.},

The texts are preceded by a substantial introduction, which surveys the geography, history, writing habits, social and political structure, economy, religion, and law of Crete in this period.

abstract = {This article explores in detail the mysterious lacuna in the record of Knossos during the sixth century BC, between the abandonment of the collective tombs of the Early Iron Age and the revival of the city's fortunes in Classial times. The archaeological evidence, indicating a deep recession, is marshalled in three chronological sections: (i) the full stop in the seventh century, (ii) the Archaic gap, and (iii) recovery in the fifth century. Parallel developments at Amnisos are also discussed. In the light of any relevant clues from the written record, we evaluate the likelihood of various possible causes of the sixth-century recession at Knossos, whether natural or human. /// Το $\alpha$$\upsilon$$\tau$ό $\delta$$\iota$$\epsilon$$\rho$$\epsilon$$\upsilon$$\nu$ά $\lambda$$\epsilon$$\pi$$\tau$ο$\mu$$\epsilon$$\rho$ώς $\tau$ο $\mu$$\upsilon$$\sigma$$\tau$$\eta$$\rho$$\iota$ώ$\delta$$\epsilon$ς $\kappa$$\epsilon$$\nu$ό $\pi$ο$\upsilon$ $\delta$$\iota$$\alpha$$\pi$$\iota$$\sigma$$\tau$ώ$\nu$$\epsilon$$\tau$$\alpha$$\iota$ $\sigma$$\tau$$\alpha$ $\delta$$\epsilon$$\delta$ο$\mu$έ$\nu$$\alpha$ $\tau$$\eta$ς Κ$\nu$$\omega$$\sigma$$\sigma$ού $\kappa$$\alpha$$\tau$ά $\tau$ο$\nu$ 60 $\alpha$$\iota$, $\pi$.

Extensively illustrated with maps and hundreds of unusual photographs, and ranging across disciplines, subject matter and chronology from early humans and the origins of farming and metallurgy to the rise of civilizations - Egyptian, Levantine, Minoan, Mycenaean, Phoenician, Etruscan, early Greek, and ulimately pre-Mediterranean - 'The Making of the Middle Sea' has already been recognized in pre-publication reviews as a seminal work.},

It also offers easier ways of building the Mediterranean into ‘connected histories' of much larger geographical reference.},

abstract = {I borrow the main term of my title from a forthcoming paper by the anthropologist Michael Herzfeld, in which he once again interprets the sin of Mediterraneanism that he invented. Now he sees it as an excuse of various kindspolitical, cultural, even (in a scholarly sense) heuristic. He argues, rightly, that the category Mediterranean should be an object of ethnographic enquiry: it should lie within our frame, whether we are ethnographers or historians; it should not constitute the frame itself. In this paper, therefore, I try to see what the Mediterranean has been an excuse for within modern historical writing: first, briefly, in Braudel; then in four alternatives to Braudel that I detect in the present age of late post-modernism: that of the reductivist, the rhapsode, the reflexive, and the realist. I end by outlining the eclectic reflexive realism of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea (2000). Droits},

abstract = {The Linear B administration centered on Knossos in the LM III period is put into a wider context through an examination of administrative structures operating on Crete in three other periods: the Palatial, the Classical-Roman, and the Venetian periods. From this examination, two broad conclusions emerge. First, there is no natural single administrative center for the island of Crete. In periods when a single center has existed, such a system has been imposed from the outside. This observation may imply that Knossos's position as a single administrative center was inherently unstable, or was externally imposed. Second, "natural" divisions of Crete are based on topographically defined regions of varying size. When the island has been autonomous, there have been a number of such divisions forming the upper level of the administrative hierarchy. In periods when Crete has formed a part of a larger, off-island system, these same units have been incorporated at a lower level in the administrative hierarchy. It seems likely that Knossos conformed to this pattern in establishing its administrative system by incorporating preexisting units, but at a lower level. When viewed in this context, it is possible to understand features of the LM III period such as the absence of palaces and apparent disappearance of Linear A place-names.},

annote = {Bennet, 1995. Space Through Time: diachronic perspectives on the spatial organization of the Pylian state: 
{\textperiodcentered}         Seeks to reconstruct the emergence of Pylos' pre-eminence in the region by first reconstructing the political geography c.1200 and its destruction and then through arch tracing back to late MH 
{\textperiodcentered}         This should be possible as the documents have a specifically geographic aspect, in a way which reflects certain hierarchies and relationships between settlements in the region 
{\textperiodcentered}         There is a distinction in the minds of the admin between ‘this-side-of-Aigeleon', de-we-ro-a-ko-ra-i-ja and ‘beyond-Aigeleon' pe-ra- ko-ra-i-ja, which we call Hither and Further provinces 
{\textperiodcentered}         Within these provinces, the names of a number of sites/places appear, often listed in order, such as on Jn 829 and Cn 608 and Vn20 – they appear in the same order of each of these and so may be itinerary lists of associated provinces/towns etc. 
{\textperiodcentered}         They are commonly mentioned along w/ the names of officials – korete and prokorete – are listed as contributing produce (Ma/Cn 608/Jn 829) or assigned wine (Vn20) 
{\textperiodcentered}         Most scholars agree that the places of HP and FP lay respectively west and east of the modern Aigaleon range and its southward extension through the mountains now known as Manglavas and Lykodimos 
{\textperiodcentered}         One list, An661, which apparently lists groups to be watching the coast may present a N-S sequence of settlements containing both HP and FP sites, probably coastal 
{\textperiodcentered}         Pylos is referred to in documents as pu-ro, but does not appear in any of these lists, perhaps not surprising as is itself the head 
{\textperiodcentered}         But a name that does appear is rendered as Leuktron: 
o   The Aa and Ad documents list 28 female work groups at Pylos (377 women preserved) and 6 (67 women preserved) at Leuktron 
o   Aa 60-98 include this workforce at Leuktron and were found in assoc. w/ label Wa 114 which demonstrates its dealing w/ the FP 
o   Aa 240-1182 thus deal w/ the HP and the greater workforces of Pylos itself 
o   Could be that Leuktron held a parallel position to Pylos, i.e. regional capital 
{\textperiodcentered}         So on this basis we see a polity divided into two parts, each w/ a regional capital and w/ 9 sub-centres in the HP and 7/8 in the FP 
{\textperiodcentered}         Using survey data from the 1960sUni of Minnesota Messenia Expedition (UMME) and general locational information derived from the tablets, Joan Carothers in her PhD has suggested equations between identified sites and all those in the documents above: 
o   Using sit-size estimates from UMME for the 129 LHIIIB sites identified, 18 of the largest stand out and it is to these that the equations have been made 
o   Furthermore there are 9 in each province, more or less as predicted by the tablets 
{\textperiodcentered}         There are however some 240 places listed in all the Pylos documents, while the UMME identified only 129, of which only 20{\%} are 0.5ha or smaller, a very low {\%} in comp to other regions in the period so it is likely at the lower end of the scale that sites have been missed 
o   This contrasts w/ the situation at Knossos where c.100 names are listed, but survey there suggests almost twice as many sites – meaning that recording at Pylos may have been at a finer level, if it is not simply preservation bias 
o   This is further implied by the 80 place names (30{\%}) at Pylos which only appear w/ one ideogram, presumably related to one sphere of palace economy – 38 only occur in context of flax production – thus may be very small farming/production sites 
o   Suggests this could point to a more simple, 3-tiered hierarchy in Messenia, reflecting its faster crystallisation and shorter lifespan than Crete 
{\textperiodcentered}         The texts would seem to imply that, to have a further province means the hither one probably came first – thus suggests that some of the sites repped independent polities at some stage and that territorial expansion is likely to have occurred 
{\textperiodcentered}         Tumuli are the primary higher burial form in the MH period but into LHI the tholos tomb becomes an expression of more elite status and burial 
o   They can be seen at Koryfasion/Myron (Peristeria)/Routsi/Tragana and less clear examples at Malthi/Ellinika/Elliniko and can probably be inferred to be places of burgeoning social stratification 
o   Tholos IV at Ano Englianos can be seen as part of this phenomenon – constructed in LHI and in use into LHIIIB, while the ‘Grave Circle' was likely a slightly earlier tholos 
o   Tholos III was also built just S of the palace, but the town (now Hora) Volimidia has none perhaps suggesting early influence of the elite from the hill 
{\textperiodcentered}         The expansion of power at Englianos may be reflected in the falling out of use of the tholoi at sites in the vicinity go out of use in LHIIIA – perhaps the subsuming of local elites 
o   The site of Nichoria identified as the Pylian ti-mi-to a-ke-e grew to c.5ha in the LHIIIA period, w/ a megaron constructed in LHIIIA1, which went out of use in LHIIIA2 – a new tholos tomb comes into use here at the same time, when an older one becomes disused 
o   The site of Mouriatada to the N of Pylos seems to belong entirely to the LHIIIB period, continuing maybe in to C – a fortified settlement w/ Megaron and painted plaster walls 
o   Important as the nearby site of Peristeria has three early tholos tombs (LHI-II), and though some LHIIIA-B material on the site, the tombs seem to fall out of use then 
{\S}  Possible that w/ the fall of Peristeria, Mouriatada was constructed as a new, loyal settlement w/in the Pylian polity},

annote = {Killen, 2008. Mycenaean Economy: 
{\textperiodcentered}         Argues that it is not the later Greek and Roman world that offers best insight onto the economy of the Mycenaean period but rather the contemporary or earlier ancient Near East or similar economies p159 
{\textperiodcentered}         Ventris and Chadwick both highlighted the similarities between the Lin B tablets and the records of such socs 
{\textperiodcentered}         1957 – M I Finley argued that these observed resemblances were similar economic systems – the movement of goods and the employment of labour was not mediated by the market (or money) but rather the authority of some redistributive agency 
o   In the Near East this was the central palace or temple, in the Mycenaean world it was the palace p159-160 
{\textperiodcentered}         Subsequent work does not lead him to believe that this general scheme needs to be altered, though we have found out more about the workings of the taxation and industrial production systems of the palaces 
{\textperiodcentered}         There are differences between the palaces, and the term ‘Mycenaean economy' should not be taken to imply this was one interconnected or homogenous entity: 
o   For instance there seems to be a greater amount of centralisation of the state controlled textile industry at Pylos than at Knossos 
o   However a large degree of similarity or conformity, and thus communication is implied by the many close similarities between the records of palatial practices 
{\S}  For instance the titles of officials, the categories of land holdings, the similarities of taxation procedures and so on 
{\S}  ‘Such are the undoubted similarities between the economies of the various states that a synthetic approach of the kind I attempt here does seem warranted' (note 5) 
{\S}  For instance, this is just as true as the evidence for a consistent Mycenaean dialect which we see in the tablets 
{\textperiodcentered}         Finley, 1973: 28f describing the economies of the Near East: 
o   These economies ‘were dominated by large palace – or temple – complexes, who owned the greater part of the arable, virtually monopolized anything that can be called ‘industrial production' as well as foreign trade {\ldots} and organized the economic, military, political and religious life of the society through a single complicated, bureaucratic, record keeping operation' 
o   There were also private landholders and craftsmen, but he does not view these as the prevailing pattern in the economy p161 
o   And argues this contrasts w/ the prevailing Roman and Greek pattern of private ownership and trade 
{\textperiodcentered}         The nature of the evidence: p162 
o   They provide only a temporary record – they are really aides-m{\'{e}}moire which also near entirely relate to the final year of the palaces operation 
o   Thus no trends are discernible and also the record for the whole year is hardly present – virtually no info on external relations and so no external trade is accessible while they are also vague enough that we get no concrete answers such as for instance regarding the ultimate ownership of the land 
o   They may also be unbalanced – as bureaucratic docs they deal w/ the admin and the palace's doings and so may overstate (consciously or not) the importance of the palace to the local and regional economy 
{\textperiodcentered}         Ownership and tenure of land: 
o   Though we cannot say who had ultimate ownership, we can say that members of the palatial authority had effective control over large tracts of arable land 
o   Main evidence is the E-series from Pylos: 
{\S}  There is clear interest in the land by the palace authority but we cannot be sure as to the nature of that interest or indeed where the plots are 
{\S}  But the owners/land-holders of the Er and Es 650 tablets are expected to make contributions of wheat/equivalent in other agri products to Poseidon and others and these contributions are linked somehow to amounts of GRA (wheat) shown at the ends of the records 
{\S}  All E- tablets end in such GRA figures and so they are perhaps all the same function, namely expected contributions, and w/ regards to the Er series these could be proportional to the size of land holdings 
{\S}  Duties of some form are also mentioned on many records and so it appears that obligations of material or personal nature were expected from the holders of land 
o   The nature of the holdings is less certain – a number of holders identified by name but also by professional description, some being stated craftsmen ‘of' wanax or lawagetas and so may be allocated these lands by the palatial authorities 
{\S}  But we cannot be sure if this means the palace ‘owns' the land, or has it as part of a royal estate – in at least some cases the land is described as pa-ro da-mo­ or from the damos 
{\S}  Therefore some, if not most, of the land may belong to the damos, whatever that body actually comprises, but is at least partially open to acquisition or distribution by the palace 
{\S}  ‘while the damos land on the E-tablets would presumably have not been recorded in the palace archives if the palace did not have at least a degree of control over it, there is much to suggest that it was not something coterminous with the central power' p165 
o   We should be careful in extrapolating out too far from this evidence though – only 5 localities are mentioned in the E tablets, at least one of which pa-ki-ja-ne seems to be close to the palace, and the very nature of the holders –religious personal/royal craftsmen etc. may suggest exceptional and not common dealings 
o   Evidence for a close control of the vicinity and lesser control of outliers: 
{\S}  Tablets from Knossos refer often to the places qa-ra and ti-ri-to which again seem to be close to the palace 
{\S}  A land record from Thebes relates in part to the vicinity of the centre 
{\S}  Difference between Ma (district) and Na (localities) records, where taxes seem based on taxable capacity of the districts as a whole, and not individual land holders, and the PY Er 312, 880, Un 718 and Es tablets which as noted show roughly proportional land to contribution ratios 
{\S}  Those contributions of Na tablets are often multiples of 10 units/30 most common while GRA amounts on Es tablets frequently include fractions 
o   However, there is evidence of greater depth of knowledge/interest/power in more distant parts: 
{\S}  PY Nn 831 (prob relates to a locality summarised in the Na series w/ rough calculations) reveals knowledge of identities of individual flax SA providers within an area (likely ko-ri-to that is Korinthos or Corinth) – some are mentioned by name a-mu-ta-wo while others have titles ka-ke-u (smith) 
{\S}  And in Na series there are those tablets w/ e-ke ekho meaning ‘he has/holds' and e-ko-si which is ‘they have/hold' 
{\S}  These are likely land holdings and the following SA entries are the relevant contributions and some such as PY Na 334 reference individuals including holdings of the king – wa-na-ka e-ke – this is described as free of tax or remitted 
{\S}  Whatever the meaning of such tablets it is clear that in some instances more detailed knowledge was desired and clearly w/in the power of the palace 
o   Obligations such as service as rowers may be another aspect of land tenure as implied by PY An 724 which can reasonably be interpreted as a list of exemptions from rowing for a set of landholders – suggested they would otherwise be liable to such service 
{\textperiodcentered}         References to the hither and further provinces in the Pylos documents and towns such as Phaistos in the Knossos documents make plain that dealings of some kind, and possibly authority of taxation, were occurring over significant distances 
{\textperiodcentered}         There is no way to quantify total amounts of individual commodities paid to the centre, we have some evidence of significant proportions of total production being paid from far afield: 
o   Knossos F(2) 852 records a min of 10,000 portions of WHEAT in connection w/ da-wo in the S of the island (as much as 775 tons) 
o   Sim the Da-Dg SHEEP records record somewhere around 100,000 animals located in the centre of the island and w/ targets set for wool production – based on evidence for the sheep carrying capacity of Crete today this is likely a very substantial proportion of those present in the area at the time 
{\textperiodcentered}         There is no evidence for a market of money in Mycenaean times and this along w/ the documents make clear the palace played a central redistributive role 
{\textperiodcentered}         There is no evidence that the palace was involved in simple forms of industrial production such as net making/coarse ware pottery production/obsidian blade working but more specialised industries seem attested – trade names on tablets and the degree of skill evidenced in the crafts point to complex division of labour (e.g. (female) decorator of cloth or head-band maker etc.) 
o         In a non-monetary/non-market economy such levels of organisation could not be sustained w/out intervention of a central authority able to gain resources/manage labour and redistribute revenue in form of materials and food 
o   ‘without the existence of such a redistributive system, there would have been no means ain a world which lacked markets for a highly specialised worker to obtain his livelihood' p175 
o   The arch evidence of storage and bureaucracy was a big pointer, such as storage magazines at Knossos, and documents confirm this 
o   Records at Knossos, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae all document allocation of materials such as wool and bronze to workers, and to production resulting from this 
o   Knossos Lc CLOTH and WOOL records deal w/ ‘targets' for textile production/Od(1) and Le records in same hand refer to later stages of process 
o   Ab records at Pylos record rations given to groups of women and their children, including women specialising in textile production 
o   Storage would have occurred w/ many goods (Knossos Ld[1] CLOTH and Sd CHARIOT tablets record stores likely at the centre and some would likely have been conspicuously displayed such as perhaps elaborate furniture of the Pylos Ta tablets and also exchange was likely though little direct evidence},

{\textperiodcentered}         The tax/contribution documents make clear a near 17{\%} average greater burden placed on the FP province and if this is a later addition to the polity could this be an exploitative act 
{\textperiodcentered}         Some Ma texts mention a tax exemption for bronze smiths, suggesting the great ritual and economic importance of the metal across the region 
o   There are documents making assignments of raw bronze to workshops, but the absence of many of the bigger place names suggest this was perhaps an activity not undertaken right in the vicinity of the palaces/centres 
{\textperiodcentered}         The many documents such as Un 138 which records offerings including barley, cattle/pigs/ sheep/olives/wine make clear that this produce is being acquisitioned for consumptive and presentational purposes 
Conspicuous display in the period has moved away from the private expressions of the tholos tomb period to a very public affair under the orchestration of the palace},

@article{Antonaccio1994,
abstract = {Greek hero cult has been extensively discussed by both archaeologists and philologists. This paper considers two current hypotheses: one links the development of hero cult in the eighth century B. C. with the circulation of Homeric poetry; the other views hero cult as a transformation of ancestral veneration in the context of the emergent polis. A review of the archaeological evidence for the Iron Age and Early Archaic period suggests that the earliest hero cult in the archaeological record emerged at Sparta during the eighth century. The small number of early hero cults, and their location and distribution, do not lend support to the theory of Homeric influence. Veneration of ancestors, on the other hand, was practiced widely in the Greek world throughout the Iron Age; it did not disappear with the emergence of the polis and hero cult. Rather than a single, unified concept, ancestral and hero cult articulated different versions of the past. Conflicting or competing concepts, both ritual and epic, serve to debate the past within and between communities. In Greece, as elsewhere, the debate helps to mediate social change within a framework of culturally determined rules.},
