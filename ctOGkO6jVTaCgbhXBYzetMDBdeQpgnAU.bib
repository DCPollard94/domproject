The texts of the inscriptions, many of which are fragmentary and relatively unknown, are accompanied by an English translation and also two commentaries; one focused on epigraphical and linguistic issues, and the other, requiring no knowledge of Greek, focused on legal and historical issues. The texts are preceded by a substantial introduction, which surveys the geography, history, writing habits, social and political structure, economy, religion, and law of Crete in this period.

  abstract = {This article explores in detail the mysterious lacuna in the record of Knossos during the sixth century BC, between the abandonment of the collective tombs of the Early Iron Age and the revival of the city's fortunes in Classial times. The archaeological evidence, indicating a deep recession, is marshalled in three chronological sections: (i) the full stop in the seventh century, (ii) the Archaic gap, and (iii) recovery in the fifth century. Parallel developments at Amnisos are also discussed. In the light of any relevant clues from the written record, we evaluate the likelihood of various possible causes of the sixth-century recession at Knossos, whether natural or human. /// {$To$} {$\alpha\upsilon\tau$}\'o {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\epsilon\rho\epsilon\upsilon\nu$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\lambda\epsilon\pi\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\rho\acute{\omega}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o$} {$\mu\upsilon\sigma\tau\eta\rho\$\imath$}ota\${$\acute{\omega}\delta\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\pi{}o\upsilon$} {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha\pi\$\imath$}ota\${$\sigma\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\epsilon\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$K\nu\$$}\o{}mega\${$\sigma\sigma{}o\acute{\upsilon}$} {$\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$, {$\pi$}. {$X$}., {$\sigma\tau{}o$} {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\tau\eta\mu\alpha$} {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\epsilon\gamma\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\epsilon\$\imath$}ota\${$\psi\eta$} {$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$o\mu\alpha\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\phi\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\Pi\rho\acute{\omega}\$\imath$}ota\${$\mu\eta\varsigma$} {$E\pi{}o\chi\acute{\eta}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\upsilon$} {$\Sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\delta\acute{\eta}\rho{}o\upsilon$} {$\mu\acute{\epsilon}\chi\rho\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\beta\acute{\iota}\$$}\o{}mega\${$\sigma\eta$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi$}\'o{$\lambda\epsilon\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\kappa\lambda\alpha\sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\chi\rho$}\'o{$\nu\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$}. {$T\alpha$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$o\lambda{}o\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$}, {$\tau\alpha$} {$o\pi{}o\acute{\iota}\alpha$} {$\upsilon\pi{}o\delta\eta\lambda\acute{\omega}\nu{}o\upsilon\nu$} {$\mu\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$} {$\sigma{}o\beta\alpha\rho\acute{\eta}$} {$\acute{\upsilon}\phi\epsilon\sigma\eta$}, {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\sigma{}o\nu\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\sigma\epsilon$} {$\tau\rho\epsilon\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\chi\rho{}o\nu{}o\lambda{}o\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa{}o\acute{\upsilon}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\acute{\iota}\varsigma$}: ({$I$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\tau\acute{\epsilon}\lambda{}o\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 70 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$, ({$II$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\ddot{\iota}\kappa$}\'o {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\kappa\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$({$III$}) {$\eta$} {$\alpha\nu$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\kappa\alpha\mu\psi\eta$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 50 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$. {$\Sigma\upsilon\zeta\eta\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\epsilon\pi\acute{\iota}\sigma\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi\alpha\rho$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\lambda\eta\lambda\alpha$} {$\phi\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$\nu$}\'o{$\mu\epsilon\nu\alpha$} {$\sigma\tau\eta\nu$} {$A\mu\nu\$\imath$}ota\${$\sigma\sigma$}\'o {$K$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\$ {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau{}o$} {$\phi\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$\sigma\chi\epsilon\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\phi{}o\rho\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\sigma\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\gamma\rho\alpha\pi\tau\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\pi\eta\gamma\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$}, {$\alpha\xi\$\imath$}ota\${$o\lambda{}o\gamma\epsilon\acute{\iota}\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$o$} {$\beta\alpha\$$}\th{}eta\${$\mu$}\'o{$\varsigma$} {$\pi\$\imath$}ota\$\$\th{}eta\${$\alpha\nu$}\'o{$\tau\eta\tau\alpha\varsigma$} {$\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$} {$\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\pi{}o\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\iota}\lambda\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$\tau\acute{\iota}\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\phi\upsilon\sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\acute{\eta}$} {$\alpha\nu\$$}\th{}eta\${$\rho\acute{\omega}\pi\$\imath$}ota\${$\nu\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\upsilon\phi\acute{\epsilon}\sigma\epsilon\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$.},

Now he sees it as an excuse of various kindspolitical, cultural, even (in a scholarly sense) heuristic. He argues, rightly, that the category Mediterranean should be an object of ethnographic enquiry: it should lie within our frame, whether we are ethnographers or historians; it should not constitute the frame itself. In this paper, therefore, I try to see what the Mediterranean has been an excuse for within modern historical writing: first, briefly, in Braudel; then in four alternatives to Braudel that I detect in the present age of late post-modernism: that of the reductivist, the rhapsode, the reflexive, and the realist. I end by outlining the eclectic reflexive realism of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea (2000). Droits},

  volume = {94},
  abstract = {The Linear B administration centered on Knossos in the LM III period is put into a wider context through an examination of administrative structures operating on Crete in three other periods: the Palatial, the Classical-Roman, and the Venetian periods. From this examination, two broad conclusions emerge. First, there is no natural single administrative center for the island of Crete. In periods when a single center has existed, such a system has been imposed from the outside. This observation may imply that Knossos's position as a single administrative center was inherently unstable, or was externally imposed. Second, "natural" divisions of Crete are based on topographically defined regions of varying size. When the island has been autonomous, there have been a number of such divisions forming the upper level of the administrative hierarchy. In periods when Crete has formed a part of a larger, off-island system, these same units have been incorporated at a lower level in the administrative hierarchy. It seems likely that Knossos conformed to this pattern in establishing its administrative system by incorporating preexisting units, but at a lower level. When viewed in this context, it is possible to understand features of the LM III period such as the absence of palaces and apparent disappearance of Linear A place-names.},

  abstract = {Greek hero cult has been extensively discussed by both archaeologists and philologists. This paper considers two current hypotheses: one links the development of hero cult in the eighth century B. C. with the circulation of Homeric poetry; the other views hero cult as a transformation of ancestral veneration in the context of the emergent polis. A review of the archaeological evidence for the Iron Age and Early Archaic period suggests that the earliest hero cult in the archaeological record emerged at Sparta during the eighth century. The small number of early hero cults, and their location and distribution, do not lend support to the theory of Homeric influence. Veneration of ancestors, on the other hand, was practiced widely in the Greek world throughout the Iron Age; it did not disappear with the emergence of the polis and hero cult. Rather than a single, unified concept, ancestral and hero cult articulated different versions of the past. Conflicting or competing concepts, both ritual and epic, serve to debate the past within and between communities. In Greece, as elsewhere, the debate helps to mediate social change within a framework of culturally determined rules.},

Parallel developments at Amnisos are also discussed. In the light of any relevant clues from the written record, we evaluate the likelihood of various possible causes of the sixth-century recession at Knossos, whether natural or human. /// {$To$} {$\alpha\upsilon\tau$}\'o {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\epsilon\rho\epsilon\upsilon\nu$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\lambda\epsilon\pi\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\rho\acute{\omega}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o$} {$\mu\upsilon\sigma\tau\eta\rho\$\imath$}ota\${$\acute{\omega}\delta\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\pi{}o\upsilon$} {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha\pi\$\imath$}ota\${$\sigma\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\epsilon\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$K\nu\$$}\o{}mega\${$\sigma\sigma{}o\acute{\upsilon}$} {$\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$, {$\pi$}. {$X$}., {$\sigma\tau{}o$} {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\tau\eta\mu\alpha$} {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\epsilon\gamma\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\epsilon\$\imath$}ota\${$\psi\eta$} {$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$o\mu\alpha\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\phi\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\Pi\rho\acute{\omega}\$\imath$}ota\${$\mu\eta\varsigma$} {$E\pi{}o\chi\acute{\eta}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\upsilon$} {$\Sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\delta\acute{\eta}\rho{}o\upsilon$} {$\mu\acute{\epsilon}\chi\rho\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\beta\acute{\iota}\$$}\o{}mega\${$\sigma\eta$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi$}\'o{$\lambda\epsilon\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\kappa\lambda\alpha\sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\chi\rho$}\'o{$\nu\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$}. {$T\alpha$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$o\lambda{}o\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$}, {$\tau\alpha$} {$o\pi{}o\acute{\iota}\alpha$} {$\upsilon\pi{}o\delta\eta\lambda\acute{\omega}\nu{}o\upsilon\nu$} {$\mu\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$} {$\sigma{}o\beta\alpha\rho\acute{\eta}$} {$\acute{\upsilon}\phi\epsilon\sigma\eta$}, {$\delta\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\sigma{}o\nu\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\sigma\epsilon$} {$\tau\rho\epsilon\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\chi\rho{}o\nu{}o\lambda{}o\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa{}o\acute{\upsilon}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\acute{\iota}\varsigma$}: ({$I$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\tau\acute{\epsilon}\lambda{}o\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 70 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$, ({$II$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\ddot{\iota}\kappa$}\'o {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\kappa\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$({$III$}) {$\eta$} {$\alpha\nu$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\kappa\alpha\mu\psi\eta$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 50 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$. {$\Sigma\upsilon\zeta\eta\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$\epsilon\pi\acute{\iota}\sigma\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi\alpha\rho$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\lambda\eta\lambda\alpha$} {$\phi\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$\nu$}\'o{$\mu\epsilon\nu\alpha$} {$\sigma\tau\eta\nu$} {$A\mu\nu\$\imath$}ota\${$\sigma\sigma$}\'o {$K$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\$ {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau{}o$} {$\phi\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\tau\$$}\o{}mega\${$\nu$} {$\sigma\chi\epsilon\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\phi{}o\rho\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\sigma\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\gamma\rho\alpha\pi\tau\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\pi\eta\gamma\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$}, {$\alpha\xi\$\imath$}ota\${$o\lambda{}o\gamma\epsilon\acute{\iota}\tau\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$ {$o$} {$\beta\alpha\$$}\th{}eta\${$\mu$}\'o{$\varsigma$} {$\pi\$\imath$}ota\$\$\th{}eta\${$\alpha\nu$}\'o{$\tau\eta\tau\alpha\varsigma$} {$\gamma\$\imath$}ota\${$\alpha$} {$\tau\$\imath$}ota\${$\varsigma$} {$\pi{}o\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\iota}\lambda\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\${$\tau\acute{\iota}\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\phi\upsilon\sigma\$\imath$}ota\${$\kappa\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\acute{\eta}$} {$\alpha\nu\$$}\th{}eta\${$\rho\acute{\omega}\pi\$\imath$}ota\${$\nu\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\upsilon\phi\acute{\epsilon}\sigma\epsilon\$$}\o{}mega\${$\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\$\imath$}ota\$.},

Defining Mediterranean space in this way avoids some disadvantages of traditional views and fits more closely with cultural preoccupations in at least some periods of Mediterranean history. It also offers easier ways of building the Mediterranean into `connected histories' of much larger geographical reference.},

Now he sees it as an excuse of various kindspolitical, cultural, even (in a scholarly sense) heuristic. He argues, rightly, that the category Mediterranean should be an object of ethnographic enquiry: it should lie within our frame, whether we are ethnographers or historians; it should not constitute the frame itself. In this paper, therefore, I try to see what the Mediterranean has been an excuse for within modern historical writing: first, briefly, in Braudel; then in four alternatives to Braudel that I detect in the present age of late post-modernism: that of the reductivist, the rhapsode, the reflexive, and the realist. I end by outlining the eclectic reflexive realism of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea (2000). Droits},

More accurately, Binford's domain should be called "formation theory." By whatever name used, archaeologists differ greatly in our views of its role and status. Somehow, formation theory has come to be viewed as method but not theory, and as intrinsic to materialism, but irrelevant if not antithetical to other ontologies. Yet it is as critical to the contextual understanding of the past sought by many archaeologists today\textemdash{}a role that, among others, belies formation theory's marginal status in academic practice.

This paper considers two current hypotheses: one links the development of hero cult in the eighth century B. C. with the circulation of Homeric poetry; the other views hero cult as a transformation of ancestral veneration in the context of the emergent polis. A review of the archaeological evidence for the Iron Age and Early Archaic period suggests that the earliest hero cult in the archaeological record emerged at Sparta during the eighth century. The small number of early hero cults, and their location and distribution, do not lend support to the theory of Homeric influence. Veneration of ancestors, on the other hand, was practiced widely in the Greek world throughout the Iron Age; it did not disappear with the emergence of the polis and hero cult. Rather than a single, unified concept, ancestral and hero cult articulated different versions of the past. Conflicting or competing concepts, both ritual and epic, serve to debate the past within and between communities. In Greece, as elsewhere, the debate helps to mediate social change within a framework of culturally determined rules.},

The texts are preceded by a substantial introduction, which surveys the geography, history, writing habits, social and political structure, economy, religion, and law of Crete in this period.

  title = {Knossos: {{The Archaic Gap}}},
  volume = {94},
  abstract = {This article explores in detail the mysterious lacuna in the record of Knossos during the sixth century BC, between the abandonment of the collective tombs of the Early Iron Age and the revival of the city's fortunes in Classial times. The archaeological evidence, indicating a deep recession, is marshalled in three chronological sections: (i) the full stop in the seventh century, (ii) the Archaic gap, and (iii) recovery in the fifth century. Parallel developments at Amnisos are also discussed. In the light of any relevant clues from the written record, we evaluate the likelihood of various possible causes of the sixth-century recession at Knossos, whether natural or human. /// {$To$} {$\alpha\upsilon\tau$}\'o {$\delta\iota\epsilon\rho\epsilon\upsilon\nu$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\lambda\epsilon\pi\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\rho\acute{\omega}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o$} {$\mu\upsilon\sigma\tau\eta\rho\iota\acute{\omega}\delta\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\pi{}o\upsilon$} {$\delta\iota\alpha\pi\iota\sigma\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\epsilon\tau\alpha\iota$} {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$K\nu\omega\sigma\sigma{}o\acute{\upsilon}$} {$\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\iota$}, {$\pi$}. {$X$}., {$\sigma\tau{}o$} {$\delta\iota$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\tau\eta\mu\alpha$} {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\epsilon\gamma\kappa\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\epsilon\iota\psi\eta$} {$\tau\omega\nu$} {$o\mu\alpha\delta\iota\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\phi\omega\nu$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\Pi\rho\acute{\omega}\iota\mu\eta\varsigma$} {$E\pi{}o\chi\acute{\eta}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\upsilon$} {$\Sigma\iota\delta\acute{\eta}\rho{}o\upsilon$} {$\mu\acute{\epsilon}\chi\rho\iota$} {$\tau\eta\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\beta\acute{\iota}\omega\sigma\eta$} {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi$}\'o{$\lambda\epsilon\omega\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau\alpha$} {$\kappa\lambda\alpha\sigma\iota\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\chi\rho$}\'o{$\nu\iota\alpha$}. {$T\alpha$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\iota{}o\lambda{}o\gamma\iota\kappa$}{\'$\alpha$} {$\delta\epsilon\delta{}o\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\alpha$}, {$\tau\alpha$} {$o\pi{}o\acute{\iota}\alpha$} {$\upsilon\pi{}o\delta\eta\lambda\acute{\omega}\nu{}o\upsilon\nu$} {$\mu\iota\alpha$} {$\sigma{}o\beta\alpha\rho\acute{\eta}$} {$\acute{\upsilon}\phi\epsilon\sigma\eta$}, {$\delta\iota\alpha\tau$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\sigma\sigma{}o\nu\tau\alpha\iota$} {$\sigma\epsilon$} {$\tau\rho\epsilon\iota\varsigma$} {$\chi\rho{}o\nu{}o\lambda{}o\gamma\iota\kappa{}o\acute{\upsilon}\varsigma$} {$\tau{}o\mu\epsilon\acute{\iota}\varsigma$}: ({$I$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\tau\acute{\epsilon}\lambda{}o\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 70 {$\alpha\iota$}, ({$II$}) {$\tau{}o$} {$\alpha\rho\chi\alpha\ddot{\iota}\kappa$}\'o {$\kappa\epsilon\nu$}\'o {$\kappa\alpha\iota$}({$III$}) {$\eta$} {$\alpha\nu$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\kappa\alpha\mu\psi\eta$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 50 {$\alpha\iota$}. {$\Sigma\upsilon\zeta\eta\tau\acute{\omega}\nu\tau\alpha\iota$} {$\epsilon\pi\acute{\iota}\sigma\eta\varsigma$} {$\pi\alpha\rho$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\lambda\lambda\eta\lambda\alpha$} {$\phi\alpha\iota\nu$}\'o{$\mu\epsilon\nu\alpha$} {$\sigma\tau\eta\nu$} {$A\mu\nu\iota\sigma\sigma$}\'o {$K$}{\'$\alpha$}{$\tau\omega$} {$\alpha\pi$}\'o {$\tau{}o$} {$\phi\omega\varsigma$} {$\tau\omega\nu$} {$\sigma\chi\epsilon\tau\iota\kappa\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\alpha\nu\alpha\phi{}o\rho\acute{\omega}\nu$} {$\sigma\tau\iota\varsigma$} {$\gamma\rho\alpha\pi\tau\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\pi\eta\gamma\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$}, {$\alpha\xi\iota{}o\lambda{}o\gamma\epsilon\acute{\iota}\tau\alpha\iota$} {$o$} {$\beta\alpha\mu$}\'o{$\varsigma$} {$\pi\iota\alpha\nu$}\'o{$\tau\eta\tau\alpha\varsigma$} {$\gamma\iota\alpha$} {$\tau\iota\varsigma$} {$\pi{}o\iota\kappa\acute{\iota}\lambda\epsilon\varsigma$} {$\alpha\iota\tau\acute{\iota}\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\phi\upsilon\sigma\iota\kappa\acute{\epsilon}\varsigma$} {$\acute{\eta}$} {$\alpha\nu\rho\acute{\omega}\pi\iota\nu\epsilon\varsigma$}, {$\tau\eta\varsigma$} {$\upsilon\phi\acute{\epsilon}\sigma\epsilon\omega\varsigma$} {$\sigma\tau{}o\nu$} 60 {$\alpha\iota$}.},

Extensively illustrated with maps and hundreds of unusual photographs, and ranging across disciplines, subject matter and chronology from early humans and the origins of farming and metallurgy to the rise of civilizations - Egyptian, Levantine, Minoan, Mycenaean, Phoenician, Etruscan, early Greek, and ulimately pre-Mediterranean - 'The Making of the Middle Sea' has already been recognized in pre-publication reviews as a seminal work.},

Now he sees it as an excuse of various kindspolitical, cultural, even (in a scholarly sense) heuristic. He argues, rightly, that the category Mediterranean should be an object of ethnographic enquiry: it should lie within our frame, whether we are ethnographers or historians; it should not constitute the frame itself. In this paper, therefore, I try to see what the Mediterranean has been an excuse for within modern historical writing: first, briefly, in Braudel; then in four alternatives to Braudel that I detect in the present age of late post-modernism: that of the reductivist, the rhapsode, the reflexive, and the realist. I end by outlining the eclectic reflexive realism of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea (2000). Droits},

  title = {Knossos in {{Context}} : {{Comparative Perspectives}} on the {{Linear B Administration}} of {{LM II}}-{{III Crete}}},
  volume = {94},
  abstract = {The Linear B administration centered on Knossos in the LM III period is put into a wider context through an examination of administrative structures operating on Crete in three other periods: the Palatial, the Classical-Roman, and the Venetian periods. From this examination, two broad conclusions emerge. First, there is no natural single administrative center for the island of Crete. In periods when a single center has existed, such a system has been imposed from the outside. This observation may imply that Knossos's position as a single administrative center was inherently unstable, or was externally imposed. Second, "natural" divisions of Crete are based on topographically defined regions of varying size. When the island has been autonomous, there have been a number of such divisions forming the upper level of the administrative hierarchy. In periods when Crete has formed a part of a larger, off-island system, these same units have been incorporated at a lower level in the administrative hierarchy. It seems likely that Knossos conformed to this pattern in establishing its administrative system by incorporating preexisting units, but at a lower level. When viewed in this context, it is possible to understand features of the LM III period such as the absence of palaces and apparent disappearance of Linear A place-names.},

  abstract = {Greek hero cult has been extensively discussed by both archaeologists and philologists. This paper considers two current hypotheses: one links the development of hero cult in the eighth century B. C. with the circulation of Homeric poetry; the other views hero cult as a transformation of ancestral veneration in the context of the emergent polis. A review of the archaeological evidence for the Iron Age and Early Archaic period suggests that the earliest hero cult in the archaeological record emerged at Sparta during the eighth century. The small number of early hero cults, and their location and distribution, do not lend support to the theory of Homeric influence. Veneration of ancestors, on the other hand, was practiced widely in the Greek world throughout the Iron Age; it did not disappear with the emergence of the polis and hero cult. Rather than a single, unified concept, ancestral and hero cult articulated different versions of the past. Conflicting or competing concepts, both ritual and epic, serve to debate the past within and between communities. In Greece, as elsewhere, the debate helps to mediate social change within a framework of culturally determined rules.},
